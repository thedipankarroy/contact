**Install the package** 

```terminal
npm i @thedipankarroy/contact
```

Yes I used scoped package for this one.

It will be a quick installation, then **create a `.js` file** with a name you like.
Let's say `app.js`.

Then copy paste this line in the file and save it.

```js
require('@thedipankarroy/contact')
```

You're done!

Now just open up the terminal and make sure you are in the root of the folder where you installed the package and run

```terminal
node app
```

It will print out the contact info like this

```
